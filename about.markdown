My name is Kruno Golubić.

Back in 1995, I have created my first website, and that’s how my journey into the world of IT began. I love information technology, and I Iove to pass on my knowledge to others.

In the past 20 years, I have worked as a system administrator, webmaster, project manager, head of a department, courseware author, lecturer, editor, social media manager, and teacher.

Currently, my role is related to technical writing and documentation. This allows me to combine the best of three areas that are the focus of my professional career: information technology, user support, and education.

In addition to numerous IT certificates, I hold BE in Information Technology, MA in Library and Information Science and PhD in Information and Communication Sciences.
