## Talks & Workshops
During my career, I was a speaker at different scientific and professional
conferences related to education and ICT. I have also held a great number of
talks and workshops at ICT meetups. [Take a look at some of
them](/portfolio/talks-workshops-and-seminars/).

## Scientific & Research Papers
As a student, I was working on many different projects. Results of some of those
projects were published as [scientific, research, or professional
papers](https://www.bib.irb.hr/pretraga?operators=and|34923|text|profile). Most
of them were presented at international conferences.

## Articles
I’ve written dozens of posts about different topics. Most of them were
IT-related. Take a look at [some of mine articles](/portfolio/articles/).

## Educational Materials​
I was a courseware author, editor, and reviewer for [various ICT related
courses](https://repozitorij.srce.unizg.hr/user/profile/mbz/369085).

## Websites
I’ve create my first web site back in 1995.

## Miscellaneous
There are some thing that just don’t fit in other boxes.
